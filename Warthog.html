                            <h3>WARTHOG</h3>
    <p><i>The warthog is a wild African pig known for its unique appearance and impressive physical abilities. Despite their fierce reputation, warthogs play an important role in their ecosystem by helping to maintain the balance of predator and prey populations.</i></p>

      <p><i>Warthogs are well adapted to their environment, with sharp tusks that they use for defense and to dig for roots and bulbs. They also have a tough hide that protects them from the elements and predators.</i></p>
      
      <p><i>Warthogs are social animals that live in groups called sounders, which can consist of up to 40 individuals. They are known for their strong maternal instincts, with mothers fiercely protecting their young from predators.</i></p>
      
      <p><i>In addition to their ecological importance, warthogs also have cultural significance in some African societies, where they are considered a symbol of strength and resilience.</i></p>
      
   <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
    <p>You will find the Warthogs at pen D36, right next to the Panda.</p>
