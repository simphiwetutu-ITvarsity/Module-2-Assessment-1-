                            <h3>MONKEY</h3>
    <p><i>Monkeys found in South Africa include several species of vervet monkeys, samango monkeys, and baboons. Vervet monkeys are small to medium-sized primates with a grayish-brown fur and a distinctive black face. They are social animals that live in large groups and can be found in various habitats such as forests, savannas, and urban areas.</i></p>

      <p><i>Samango monkeys are medium-sized primates with a grayish-brown fur and a bushy tail. They are found in forests and woodlands, and they are arboreal, spending most of their time in trees. Samango monkeys are also social animals and live in groups.</i></p>
      
      <p><i>Baboons are larger primates with a distinctive dog-like snout and a fur that ranges from olive to brown. They are found in various habitats such as savannas, woodlands, and mountains. Baboons are also social animals that live in troops, which can consist of up to several hundred individuals.</i></p>
      
      <p><i>Unfortunately, these monkeys are facing threats such as habitat loss, poaching, and conflict with humans. Conservation efforts are underway to protect these animals and their habitats to ensure their survival for future generations.</i></p>
   <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
