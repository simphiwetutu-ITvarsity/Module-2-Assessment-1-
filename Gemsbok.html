                            <h3>GEMSBOK</h3>
    <p><i>The gemsbok, also known as the South African oryx, is a large antelope species that is native to southern Africa. They have a striking appearance, with long, pointed horns that can reach up to 3.5 feet in length, and a distinctive black and white facial mask.</i></p>

     <p><i> Gemsboks are well adapted to life in the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, and are able to survive for long periods of time without water. They are herbivores that primarily feed on grasses, leaves, and fruit.</i></p>
      
      <p><i>Gemsboks are highly social animals that live in herds, which can consist of up to 50 individuals. They communicate with each other through a variety of visual and vocal signals, and have a highly developed sense of smell.</i></p>
      
     <p><i> Despite their ability to survive in harsh environments, gemsboks are facing threats such as habitat loss, poaching, and competition with livestock. Conservation efforts are underway to protect these majestic animals and their habitats to ensure their survival for future generations.</i></p>
   <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
    <p>You will find the Gemsboks at pen E32, right next to the Panda.</p>
