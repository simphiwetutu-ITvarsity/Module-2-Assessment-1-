                            <h3>LION</h3>
    <p><i>The lion is a large, powerful carnivorous mammal that is native to Africa. They are the only social cats and live in groups called prides, typically consisting of several females and their offspring, along with one or more males.</i></p>

      <p><i>Lions have a distinctive appearance, with a tawny-colored fur and a mane of hair around their necks that is more prominent in males. They are apex predators and primarily hunt large ungulates, such as zebras and wildebeests, using their strength, speed, and sharp claws and teeth.</i></p>
      
      <p><i>Lions are known for their roar, which can be heard up to 5 miles away and is used to communicate with other members of their pride. They are also highly territorial and will defend their territory against other lions and predators.</i></p>
      
   <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
    <p>You will find the Lion at pen D17, right next to the Lost Forest.</p>
