                            <h3>GORILLA</h3>
    <p>A gorilla is a large, powerful primate that is native to Africa. They are the largest living primates and can weigh up to 400 pounds. Gorillas have thick, dark fur that helps protect them from the cold, and they have a distinctive shape with a broad chest and muscular arms.

      Gorillas are social animals that live in groups called troops, which are typically led by a dominant male called a silverback. They are herbivores and primarily eat leaves, shoots, and fruits. Gorillas are known for their intelligence and have been observed using tools and communicating with each other through a variety of vocalizations, body language, and facial expressions.</p>

   <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
    <p>You will find the Gorillas at pen E26, right next to the Monkeys.</p>
