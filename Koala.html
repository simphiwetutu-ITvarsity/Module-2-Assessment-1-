                            <h3>KOALA</h3>

                            <p>The Koala is a small, tree-dwelling marsupial native to Australia. They have a distinctive appearance, with a round head, large furry ears, and a flat nose. Koalas have a thick, grayish-brown fur that helps protect them from the elements and predators.</p>

                              <p>Koalas are primarily herbivores and feed on eucalyptus leaves, which make up almost their entire diet. They have a unique digestive system that allows them to break down the tough leaves and extract nutrients from them.</p>
                              
                             <p>Koalas are solitary animals and spend most of their time sleeping in the trees, often in a curled-up position. They are known for their adorable appearance and gentle demeanor, which has made them popular with people around the world.</p>
   <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
    <p>You will find the Koala at pen D19, right next to the Monkeys.</p>
