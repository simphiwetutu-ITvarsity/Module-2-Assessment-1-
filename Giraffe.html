                            <h3>GIRAFFES</h3>
    <p>The giraffe is a long-necked mammal that is native to Africa. They are the tallest land animals, standing up to 18 feet tall, with long legs and a slender body. Giraffes have a distinctive spotted pattern on their fur, which varies in color from light tan to dark brown.</p>

      <p>Their long necks allow them to reach leaves and branches that other animals cannot, and they are herbivores that primarily feed on leaves from acacia trees. They have a prehensile tongue that is over a foot long and allows them to grasp branches and strip the leaves from them.</p>
      
      <p>Giraffes are social animals that live in groups called towers or herds, which can consist of up to 20 individuals. They communicate with each other through a variety of vocalizations, body language, and olfactory signals.</p>
      
   <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
    <p>You will find the Giraffes at pen E20, right next to the Tiger.</p>
