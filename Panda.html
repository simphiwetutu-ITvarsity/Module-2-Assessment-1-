                            <h3>PANDA</h3>
      <p><i>The giant panda is a bear native to China and is known for its distinctive black-and-white fur pattern. They have a round face, short tail, and large body, with adults weighing up to 300 pounds. Pandas are herbivores and primarily eat bamboo, but they also consume fruits and occasionally small animals.</i></p>
      
      <p><i>Pandas are solitary animals and spend most of their time eating and sleeping. They have a special adaptation in their digestive system that allows them to break down and digest tough bamboo. Pandas are also known for their playful behavior and can be seen rolling, climbing, and sliding down hills</i></p>
   <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
    <p>You will find the Panda at pen E39, right next to the Pizza Hut.</p>
